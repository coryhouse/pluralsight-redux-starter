#Starter Kit for [Building Applications in React and Redux in ES6](http://www.pluralsight.com/author/cory-house) on Pluralsight

## Get Started
1. **Install [Node 6](https://nodejs.org)**. Need to run multiple versions of Node? Use [nvm](https://github.com/creationix/nvm) or [nvm-windows](https://github.com/coreybutler/nvm-windows)
2. **Clone this repository.** - `git clone https://github.com/coryhouse/pluralsight-redux-starter.git` or [download the zip](https://github.com/coryhouse/pluralsight-redux-starter/archive/master.zip)
3. **Make sure you're in the directory you just created.** - `cd pluralsight-redux-starter`
4. **Install Node Packages.** - `npm install`
5. **Run the app.** - `npm start -s`
This will run the automated build process, start up a webserver, and open the application in your default browser. When doing development with this kit, this command will continue watching files all your files. Every time you hit save the code is rebuilt, linting runs, and tests run automatically. Note: The -s flag is optional. It enables silent mode which suppresses unnecessary messages during the build.
6. **Install [React developer tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/react-developer-tools/fmkadmapgofadopljbjfkapdkoienihi?hl=en) and [Redux Dev Tools](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/redux-devtools/lmhkpmbekcpmknklioeibfkpmmfibljd?hl=en)** in Chrome.
7. Having issues? See below.

## Having Issues? Try these things first:
1. Run `npm install` - If you forget to do this, you'll see this: `babel-node: command not found`.
2. Make sure the path doesn't include any spaces, or install the latest version of eslint-watch which adds support for paths containing spaces: `npm install eslint-watch@2.1.13`
3. Make sure you're running the latest version of Node.
4. Use [Node 5.12.0](https://nodejs.org/download/release/v5.12.0/) if you're having issues on Windows. Node 6 has issues on some Windows machines.
5. Don't run the project from a symbolic link. It will cause issues with file watches.
